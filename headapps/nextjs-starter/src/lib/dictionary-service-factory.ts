        GraphQL endpoint may reach its rate limit with the amount of requests it receives and throw a rate limit error.
        GraphQL Dictionary and Layout Services can handle rate limit errors from server and attempt a retry on requests.
        For this, specify the number of 'retries' the GraphQL client will attempt.
        By default it is set to 3. You can disable it by configuring it to 0 for this service.

        Additionally, you have the flexibility to customize the retry strategy by passing a 'retryStrategy'.
        By default it uses the `DefaultRetryStrategy` with exponential back-off factor of 2 and handles error codes 429,
        502, 503, 504, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 'ECONNRESET', 'ETIMEDOUT' and 'EPROTO' . You can use this class or your own implementation of `RetryStrategy`.
